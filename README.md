- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomejanzen
- 👀 I’m interested in computer music and classical music, and processing photographic images.
- 🌱 I’m keeping up with changes to C++.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate.  I may help with timidity because it seems to have lost polyphonic pressure.
- 📫 How to reach me : janzentome@gmail.com
