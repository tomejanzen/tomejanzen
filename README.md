- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomejanzen
- 👀 I’m interested in computer music and classical music, and processing photographic images.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++20.  My TCL book is sitting here so i might read it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not very much.  I may help with timidity because it seems to have lost polyphonic pressure.
- 📫 How to reach me : janzentome@gmail.com
My web site is https://www.tomejanzenfoto.com, which includes photographs and mp3s of computer and classical music.
